Delicious and I want this every day every night!
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, (or olive oil)</li>
    <li>1 brown shallot, chopped (or 1 small onion)</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>(500 g) uncooked potato gnocchi</li>
    <li>1/2 cup jarred sun dried tomato strips in oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups fresh baby spinach</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped basil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt the butter and sauté shallots until transparent, about 2 minutes. Sauté garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add the gnocchi and let sear in the butter for a minute. Add the sun dried tomatoes and reserved oil. Cook for a further minute to release flavours into the gnocchi.</li>
    <li>Pour in the chicken broth, cream and Italian herbs. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything together and reduce heat to medium. Cover pan with lid and let cook for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the spinach leaves and cook until wilted, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Stir through parmesan cheese and chopped basil. Let simmer for a further minute or until gnocchi is soft, cooked through and the sauce has thickened to your liking.</li>
    <li>Season with a little extra salt & pepper, if needed, to suit your taste.</li>
